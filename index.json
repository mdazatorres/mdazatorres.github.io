The project has developed and sourced a modular, scalable, joint military-civilian patient care facility, referred to as the Modular Surge Facility (MSF), which may be utilized to quickly expand hospital inpatient capacity during patient surge events. During mass casualty and patient surge events, healthcare systems must efficiently manage bed capacity, triage effectiveness, and resource allocation. Additionally, they must rapidly scale patient admissions to meet increasing demand in order to prevent overcrowding, care delays, and system collapse. However, traditional hospital admission models often lack the predictive and adaptive capabilities needed to respond effectively to sudden patient influxes. The IMPACTS project intends to provide a decision tool (Patient Surge Tool) to managing hospitals to help determine how expansion of patient care capacity through the utilization of an MSF will affect hospital throughput and other operational metrics.

WBE is recognized as a promising mechanism for promptly identifying infectious diseases, including COVID-19 and other novel pathogens. An important conclusion from this initiative is the critical importance of maintaining equity and expanding access to fully realize the benefits of wastewater surveillance for marginalized communities. To address this need, we propose an optimization framework that strategically allocates wastewater monitoring resources at the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) level, ensuring more effective and equitable distribution of surveillance efforts to serve underserved populations. The purpose of the framework is to obtain a balanced spatial distribution, inclusive population coverage, and efficient representation of disadvantaged groups in the allocation of resources for WBE. Furthermore, the framework concentrates on areas with high population density and gives priority to vulnerable regions, as well as identifying signals that display significant variations from other monitored sources. The optimization objective is to maximize a weighted combination of these critical factors. This problem is formulated as an integer optimization problem and solved using simulated annealing. We evaluate various scenarios, considering different weighting factors, to optimize the allocation of WWTPs with monitoring systems. This optimization framework provides an opportunity to enhance WBE by providing customized monitoring strategies created to address specific priorities and situations, thus enhancing the decision-making processes in public health responses.","tags":["Wastewater-based epidemiology","COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2","Infectious disease","Public health"],"title":"Optimizing spatial distribution of wastewater-based epidemiology to advance health equity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yury E Garcia Puerta","Miryam E Villa-Perez","Kuang Li","Xiao Hui Tai","Luis A Trejo","Maria L Daza-Torres","JC Montesinos-Lopez","Miriam Nuno"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"fe932b101afaf882e479fee7dbb45daa","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/garcia-2024-wildfires/","publishdate":"2025-04-08T18:14:22.565826Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-2024-wildfires/","section":"publication","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"Wildfires and Social Media Discourse: Exploring Mental Health and Emotional Well-Being Through Twitter","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Kalman Filter is an essential estimation algorithm used across various fields to estimate the hidden states of systems with noisy observations.
